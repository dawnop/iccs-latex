\section{Introduction}

In programming language theory(PLT), programming language design has always been an important topic. Because programming language design integrates various branches of PLT, it is the prerequisite for the final realization of programming language. By analyzing the design of modern programming languages(MPL), we can obtain the trend of programming language development, i.e., the programming language design can be fed back from the application point of view.

In recent years, many new MPLs have emerged. According to the definition and research scope of MPLs in the past, it cannot cover the current emerging modern programming languages. Therefore, this paper completes the research content of MPLs to a certain extent. Based on previous research, this paper analyzes the design of MPLs through factors, i.e., programming paradigm, type system, and performance.

By analyzing the design of MPL, this paper draws the influence of different programming language factors on the application. e.g., as programming languages evolve, why does the level of paradigm support in MPLs keep changing, what type systems are in MPLs, how MPLs keep programs efficient, and so on.
