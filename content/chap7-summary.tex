\section{summary}

As we can see, new compilation techniques are always emerging as programming languages evolve. The analysis of modern programming languages from the perspective of language design is often limited by the times. In this paper, we start from the current development status of programming languages, and provide some reference for the development direction and application scenarios of programming languages by studying the impact of each component of programming language design on the programming language itself. Programming paradigms, type systems, and performance are three interrelated components that cut across multiple aspects of programming languages from design to implementation. Each of these three branches itself has a significant impact on the design of programming languages, influencing their expressiveness, maintainability, reliability, and performance, the most important indicators of programming languages. In fact we can obtain that the process of theoretical and practical development of programming languages is always dynamic, as is the design and implementation of programming languages. This paper dynamically talks about the design of programming languages from the perspective of modern programming languages, which would be a better research idea from the perspective of programming language design and analysis.
